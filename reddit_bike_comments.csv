Never used them but also had no idea it was 35 for the year. That's a really good price I would've thought.,2023-04-17 21:58:56,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"Still good. The app is now way better and you can unlock with your phone.

If station is full, you can extend free journey by 15mins to get to next one.",2023-04-17 21:12:29,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"I think the €35 is a steal. There are times in Dublin City that I would have to get a taxi or a bus. Even if you use them once every 2 weeks to avoid a €1.5 bus fare, you are saving money. 

The bikes are heavy, but are ideal for a lot of the roads in the city that full of pot holes.",2023-04-17 22:10:08,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
Been using them for 9 months and I love em. Obviously sometimes the stations are full/empty but you gotta just work around that and have a plan B. Also being able to see station capacity and available bikes from your phone really helps.,2023-04-17 21:38:49,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"I lived in town when they first came out and it was €10 a year. Then it jumped to €25 after a few years. They were well worth it. €35 is a steal. If you where cycling one every 2 weeks you'd only be paying over €1 a spin as long as your under 30 minutes. 

I never understood why this scheme was never extended further.",2023-04-17 22:39:22,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"€35 for the year is the best deal in transport in Ireland. It's absolutely incredible. Equivalent (docked) schemes are:

* £120 a year in London
* $200 a year in New York
* $156 per year in Boston

I haven't checked European examples but we're roughly the same as Paris.

Now that you can unlock bikes via the app it's all the better. It's also accurate re: how many bikes are in a certain place. I probably use it once a week and it's worth €35 to me even at that low usage - certainly cheaper than public transport or taxis. I used it daily for a week and a half when my bike was in for repair and it was fantastic. 

I'm a huge fan, tbh. The only way it could be better is going 24/7 like Bleeper and Moby.",2023-04-18 11:32:53,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
Great but avoid electric ones. Too heavy And hard to ride... The oldest one are the best.,2023-04-18 08:56:53,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
Bleeper bike is good if you don't want to commit to 35 quid a year I found them really useful and you can leave them anywhere at a bike lock in the parking zone,2023-04-18 11:03:23,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"They're grand. Obviously they're big and bulky, but it cuts down a 25 minute walk to the office from Pearse station down to 5 or so minutes on the bike.  


I use them any day that I'm working in the office (and haven't cycled in from home). If you want to use the electric bikes you pay an extra €60 and they'll send out a battery to you in the post - I've not availed of that, though.",2023-04-18 16:42:56,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
It's a fantastic price. They even have some electric ones too,2023-04-17 21:59:58,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
I remember when it was €10 per year. Then they literally doubled it to €20 and it was still great value,2023-04-18 02:08:46,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"Oh that's good to know, I think the app only had a map on it the last time I used it. 

Can I ask - do you get to use the app and unlock bikes immediately after registering and paying, do you remember? It used to be that you'd have to wait to get a card sent to you. I'm wondering as I want to hold off on getting it until I absolutely need it.",2023-04-17 21:24:51,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
The newer bikes a lighter and have more gears. Even if you don't have the electric pack you should also guy with one of those bikes.,2023-04-20 00:50:30,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"Cool, thanks for the info. I don't plan on like commuting with them or using them when things are time sensitive so I probably will register with them. It's good to hear you're having a good experience with them, I think there has been a serious uptick in their usage the past year and the stations look like they're in top condition all the time.",2023-04-17 21:42:48,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"It annoys me that they are never quite “close” to train stations, other than heuston. Not outside GCD, a few mins walk from Pearse or Docklands, just never immediately outside a train station where you’d want it. That’s my only criticism.",2023-04-17 23:01:13,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76

"I'd say plopping one in a random spot might be a logistical nightmare in terms of those guys who have to move them around and restock them, so expanding the area must be really tricky. It also doesn't help that Dublin Bikes have definitely seen that Bleeper have had to reel in their coverage area due to the amount of bikes that are stolen/vandalised/broken in certain areas.",2023-04-17 23:06:56,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"Yeah make sure you use the correct app. I was using the map one, and my colleague magically unlocked a bike from his phone and turns out there’s a different app… typically instead of improving an existing app, they make a new one.",2023-04-17 22:59:04,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"I went from using Dublin bikes card to attaching sub to my leap card to then using the phone only.

I had some login glitches first time I had to use app, so I'd give yourself an hour advance at least.",2023-04-17 21:34:31,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
If you use them enough then the ebike subscription is absolutely worth it as well imo. Best €60 I've spent,2023-04-17 21:44:11,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"My only problem was I lived in rathmines and everyone took a bike from Portobello into town in the morning, so the station was always empty and in the evening everyone returned home and it was full , so you had to cycle around to drop it off.",2023-04-17 23:07:54,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"I wonder is that to prevent people using it for very short journeys? Also demand would be one way every morning and would empty out the stands very quickly.

There's a rack at GCD by Il Valentino which is a 5 minute walk away",2023-04-18 19:11:43,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
I remember the first role out was 450 bikes. Valencia rolled out the same scheme about 1 year after Dublin. They started with 4500 bikes. To be fair they have density to make it work better.,2023-04-18 20:29:38,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"The fixed stations are the problem. If they went for the more flexible option like bleeper bikes, it would easier and cheaper to expand.

Anyone caught vandalising should be harshly death with damaging public property. Stealing them should be difficult, they're tracked and can't really be sold on.",2023-04-17 23:18:27,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"Ah cool, thanks for letting me know. I had a feeling that these kinds of things wouldn't be immediate so I'm glad I asked. I'll register the day of rather than the last minute then so.",2023-04-17 21:40:22,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
Thank you but I don't think it'd be worth it in my case. I find myself spinning out on the front chainrings of rented bikes (as in I never change from the hardest gear and my legs are always pumping) on the windiest and wettest of days so I think I'll save myself the few bob.,2023-04-17 21:53:22,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"It was because it was the border of the scheme. The final station. So everyone living in rathmines, rathgar, Harold's cross, Portobello used that station.",2023-04-18 20:33:08,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
"I use the Docklands one in morning and evening after I get off the train, which is just by the Liffey, where it would save a few minutes walking if right by the docklands station and would make more sense there. Again, the one closest to GCD is just far enough away to make me just walk the 15 minutes to the office instead of hopping on the bike. Just a minor inconvenience that would have been better if a bit more thought was put in. I use the one near Pearse a fair bit, but again it’s a few mins walk round to the back of the station and to the road with the bikes.",2023-04-18 21:09:50,How are Dublin Bikes these days?,12pqv76
